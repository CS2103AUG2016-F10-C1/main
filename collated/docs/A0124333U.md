## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.  
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough.  
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
   
   Click [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) to download the latest Java version.
   
2. Download the latest `tars.jar` from the 'releases' tab. [*No releases available yet*]
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TARS App.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. 
5. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it.  
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window. 
6. Some example commands you can try:
   * **`ls`** : lists all tasks
   * **`add`**` Complete CS2103 Quiz 3 /dt 23/09/2016 /p h /t Quiz /t CS2103` : 
     adds a task `Complete CS2103 Quiz 3` to TARS.
   * **`del`**` 3` : deletes the 3rd task shown in TARS.
   * **`exit`** : exits the app
7. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.  


## Features
```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md
#### Reserving timeslots for a task : `rsv` 
Reserves one or more timeslot for a task  
Format: `rsv <TASK_NAME> /dt <START_DATE/TIME> to <END_DATE/TIME> [/dt <START_DATE/TIME> to <END_DATE/TIME> /dt...]`

> Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters. 
>
> More than one datetime can be added.

Examples:
* `rsv Meet John Doe /dt 26/09/2016 0900 to 1030 /dt 28/09/2016 1000 to 1130`

#### Deleting a task with reserved timeslots : `rsv /del`
Deletes a task with all its reserved time slots  
Format: `rsv /del <INDEX>`

> Deletes the task at the specific `<INDEX>`. 
> The index refers to the index number shown in the task list.
> The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...
> Delete multiple reserved tasks by typing ".." in between the range of index.

Examples:
* `rsv /del 5`
* `rsv /del 1..4`

#### Confirming a reserved timeslot : `confirm`  
Confirms a reserved timeslot for a particular tasks and removed all the other reserved time slots.  
Format: `confirm <INDEX_TASK> <INDEX_TIMESLOT> /p <PRIORITY> /t <TAG(s)>`

> Confirm the task of a specific `<INDEX_TASK>` at a timeslot of a specific `<INDEX_TIMESLOT>`  
> The `<INDEX_TASK>` refers to the index number shown in the task list.  
> The `<INDEX_TIMESLOT>` refers to the index number of the timeslot shown under each task.  
> Both indexes **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:
* `confirm 3 2 /p l /t tagname`

```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md
#### Finding tasks : `find`
Finds all tasks containing a list of keywords (i.e. AND search).  
Two modes: Quick Search & Filter Search.  
Format:
* [Quick Search]: `find <KEYWORD>[, KEYWORD, KEYWORD]`  
* [Filter Search]: `find /n <NAME_KEYWORD>[, NAME_KEYWORD, NAME_KEYWORD] /dt [START_DATE] to [END_DATE] /p [PRIORITY(h/m/l)] /do (or /ud) /t <TAG_KEYWORD>[, TAG_KEYWORD, TAG_KEYWORD]`

> **Quick Search Mode**: Find tasks quickly by entering keywords that match what is displayed in the task list  
> **Filter Search Mode**: Find tasks using task filters (i.e. /n, /p, /dt, /do, /ud, /t)  
> Use /n to filter tasks by task name
> Use /p to filter tasks by priority level
> Use /dt to filter tasks by date (in a date range)
> Use /do to filter all done tasks (Cannot be used together with /ud)
> Use /ud to filter all undone tasks (Cannot be used together with /do)
> Use /t to filter tasks by tags
> `<KEYWORD>` are **case-insensitive**. The order of the `<KEYWORD>` or `Flags` (for filter search) does not matter.

Examples: 
* `find meet John` uses Quick Search and returns all tasks containing BOTH the keywords â€œmeetâ€? and â€œJohnâ€? (e.g. meet John Doe)
* `find /n meet /dt 17/10/2016 1300 to 18/10/2016 1400` uses Filter Search and returns all tasks whose name contains "meet" and whose task date falls within the range "17/10/2016 1300 to 18/10/2016 1400" (e.g. meet Tim for dinner, 17/10/2016 1800 to 17/10/2016 1900)

```

#### Changing data storage location : `cd`
Changes the directory of which the data storage file is saved in.  
Format: `cd <FILE_PATH>`

> Returns an error if the there is an error in the directory chosen  
> Note: `<FILE_PATH>` must end with the file type extension, `.xml`. 

Examples:
* `cd C:\Users\John_Doe\Documents\tars.xml`  

#### Saving the data 
TARS data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.  
There is no need to save manually.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?  
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with 
       the file that contains the data of your previous TARS app.
